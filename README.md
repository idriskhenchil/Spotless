# Spotless
A simple script to unclutter your Mac desktop.

To get started, update `new_path` in `spotless.py` with the directory where you would like to store your files.
```
new_path = "/YOUR/NEW/PATH/HERE/"
```

If you opt to have the script move all the files to a single folder on the desktop instead, that folder will be ignored. Files starting with a period will also be ignored.



Now all you need to do is run the script.

```
python spotless.py
```

Requires: Python 3
